# RMapContextProvider

If you need to access your `map` or `mapManager` instance(s) outside the scope of `RMap`,
you'll need to wrap your App inside this component.

The component internally acts on the [`useMap`](/hooks/usemap) and [`useMapManager`](/hooks/useMapManager) hooks. 
Read their dedicated page to see details about the implementation.

```tsx
import { RMapContextProvider, RMap, useMap } from "maplibre-react-components";

function ChildComponent() {
  const map: Map | null = useMap("my-map");

  return (
    <div>
      {/* your components */}
      <RMap id="my-map"></RMap>
    </div>
  );}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <RMapContextProvider>
      <ChildComponent />
    </RMapContextProvider>
  );
}

```
